# email-spam-classifier
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The classifier is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and is deployed via a Streamlit web application.

Features
* Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop words removal, and stemming.
* Vectorization: Utilizing CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer.
* Model Training: Implemented using Naive Bayes algorithms (GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB).
* Performance Evaluation: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and precision score metrics.
* Interactive Web App: User-friendly interface to classify new emails.
